# Utah TUI

A standalone terminal UI for chatting with the agent, built on Inngest Realtime.
It is also a regular [channel](../src/channels/tui/) — the worker replies to it
the same way it replies to Slack or Telegram.

## Running

```bash
pnpm tui        # talk to Inngest Cloud (needs INNGEST_EVENT_KEY / INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY)
pnpm tui:dev    # talk to a local dev server (INNGEST_DEV=1)
```

The worker must be running too (`pnpm start` or `pnpm dev`) so there's something
to handle the messages.

```bash
pnpm tui -- <sessionId>   # resume a specific session
pnpm tui -- --new         # force a fresh session
```

With no argument it resumes your most recent session, or creates one.

## How it works

```
TUI ──inngest.send(agent.message.received)──▶ Inngest ──▶ agent loop
TUI ◀──subscribe(tui:<sessionId>)──── inngest.realtime.publish() ◀── send-reply
```

1. You type a line; the CLI sends an `agent.message.received` event directly
   (it's a trusted local client with the event key — no webhook needed).
2. The agent loop runs on the worker. The TUI channel handler publishes replies
   and a `thinking`/`idle` status to the realtime channel `tui:<sessionId>`.
3. The CLI mints a subscription token with its credentials and subscribes to
   that channel, rendering replies as they arrive.

Set `AGENT_INCREMENTAL_REPLIES=true` for streaming progress (text the model
emits between tool calls); otherwise you just get the final answer.

## Sessions and state

State lives in `~/.inngest-agent/`:

- `index.json` — all known sessions (id, timestamps, title). Multiple terminal
  windows can each run their own session simultaneously.
- `sessions/<id>.jsonl` — a local copy of each session's transcript, so a window
  can reload its history on restart. (The authoritative history is server-side.)

The session id is both the realtime channel suffix and the agent's `sessionKey`,
so each window's realtime stream only carries its own replies.

## Commands

| Command          | Action                                 |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `/clear`, `/new` | end this session and start a fresh one |
| `/sessions`      | list known sessions                    |
| `/help`          | show help                              |
| `/exit`, `/quit` | quit                                   |

## Keys

- `Ctrl+C` — clear the input (press again on an empty line to exit)
- `Ctrl+L` — redraw · `Ctrl+U` — clear line
- `↑` / `↓` — input history · `PgUp` / `PgDn` — scroll the transcript

## Troubleshooting

The TUI owns the terminal, so it logs to a file instead of stdout. Watch it:

```bash
tail -f ~/.inngest-agent/tui.log
```

Each line is JSON: subscription connects/reconnects, every realtime message
(`topic`/`kind`), sent event ids, and any errors (including captured
`console.*` output from the Inngest SDK).

**Stuck on "thinking…" and the reply never appears.** The Inngest realtime
client does not reconnect or send keepalives on its own, so an idle WebSocket
can be dropped by the gateway while the agent runs tools. The TUI now
re-subscribes automatically when the stream ends — but realtime has no replay,
so a reply published _during_ the disconnected window is lost. The log will
show `subscription stream ended` / `reconnecting subscription` around the gap.
The thinking indicator shows elapsed seconds (`thinking… 45s`) so a stall is
visible. For the raw SDK view, run with `DEBUG=inngest:realtime` (note: that
prints to stderr and will fight with the UI).
